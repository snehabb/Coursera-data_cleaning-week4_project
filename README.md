##The R run_analysis.R code in this repository primarily performs these 5 functions:

1.Merges the train and the test sets to one data set.

2.Extracts the measurements on the mean and std dev for each measurement

3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names

5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
